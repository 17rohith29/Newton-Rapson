# Newton-Rapson
A program to calculate the root of function

Creator:Rohith Prabakar, student at University of Maryland College Park.

Newton rapson technique is a technique to calculate root of a function f(x)
if we take an arbitrary c1 we use it to get a c2=c1-f(c1)/f'(c1)
we repeat it till cn-1=cn=cn+1=.... which is the root of the function f(x)
In this program we need to enter the function to which the root is to be calculated and the derivative of the function.

Mathematics behind newtons method
1)we take an arbitary value c1 and calculate the tangent to the point.
2)we figure out where the tangent line intersects the x axis.
3)this then becomes our c2
4) we repeat this process and after a sufficient no of steps we get close to the root(or even get the root of function)

[root of a function f(x) is a value b such that f(b)=0]
